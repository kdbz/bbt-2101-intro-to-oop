          Can you call the main function inside itself - like the way you call
          a recursive function?
          ====================================================================
            1. This is a bad programming construct since this is the entry point for our application
            ---- I noticed you were trying to repeatedly do what is in the main method.
                  * Rather than calling the main method, which is something that is regarded as a bad design decision, you can call another method repetitively.

         |  The main() method must indeed have a void return type. From the Java Language Specification on "Execution - Virtual Machine Start-Up" (ยง12.1.4):
         |
         |  The method main must be declared  public, static, and void. It must accept a single argument that is an array of strings.
         |  It goes on to describe when a program exits in "Execution - Program Exit" (ยง12.8):
         |
         |  A program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens:
         |
         |  All the threads that are not daemon threads terminate.
         |  Some thread invokes the exit method of class  Runtime or class System and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager.
         |  In other words, the program may exit before or after the main method finishes; a return value from  main would therefore be meaningless. If you want the program to return a status code, call one of the following methods (note that all three methods never return normally):
         |
         |    *System.exit(int status) - Equivalent to Runtime.getRuntime().exit(status)
         |    *Runtime.exit(int status) - Terminates the currently running JVM by initiating its shutdown sequence (run all registered shutdown hooks, and uninvoked finalizers, if necessary). Once this is done the JVM halts.
         |    *Runtime.halt(int status) - Forcibly terminates the currently running JVM.
         |
         |    Of the three, System.exit() is the conventional and most convenient way to terminate the JVM.
